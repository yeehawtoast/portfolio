        <h1>Hello! Hola! Howdy!</h1>
        <h1>I'm Christopher Smith, a Backend Software Engineer, a former educator, and an always student</h1>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I am a texas born and raised software engineer. I started developing as an intern for the City of Provo by building screen views for data-analysis on social media.</p>
        <p>previously I taught high school computer science, teaching python, Javascript and Java. ( I also coached an esports team, but that's for a different day ;)</p>
        <p>Currently I work as a SAP software engineer supporting the United Stated Department of Energy's mission of safeguarding, protecting, and managing our nuclear future</p>
        <p>When I am not working, I enjoy marathon running, hiking, crafting side projects and spending time with my family</p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Open Education</h2>
        <p>When I'm not busy working or doing my hobbies, I'm busy designing, crafting, and creating bite-sized lessons for learners of all ages. Having taught as an educator, resources are expensive and difficult to come by. My mission is to make teaching students beginner computer science and giving advanced students something to chew on is a goal of mine. Despite the fact that I am no longer an educator, I still miss and love teaching.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contribute!</p>
        <h2>Project-based Learning</h2>
        <p>From Advent of Code, to small, bite-sized projects, I enjoy gaining new skills and knowledge. If you are looking for something new, this could be for you.</p>
